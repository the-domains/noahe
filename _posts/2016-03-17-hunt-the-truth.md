[**Tumblr Experience**][0]

[**Soundcloud**][1]

[**iTunes**][2]

Using top-tier voice talent, led by Keegan-Michael Key, Cobie Smulders, Kumail Nanjiani, Janina Gavankar, and Mark Hamill we were able to expand upon the Halo universe with an accessible yet mystery-filled plot full of inconsistencies, lies, cover ups, and conspiracies.

The show spanned two seasons, 22 episodes and five and a half hours of audio content. The weekly episodes were syndicated on Soundcloud and iTunes Podcasts and aggregated on a Tumblr which featured documents and imagery in support of the episode. Deepening the fiction.

Generating over 12 million listens to date across Soundcloud, iTunes and fan uploads on YouTube the reaction the series has been unparalleled. Heralded by fans and critics as a seminal story telling moment for the Halo franchise and the genre of scripted audio.

I created the show for Ayzenberg, leading the team that wrote and produced it, as well as stepping into the role of director and lead editor for both seasons. Collaborating with the team at Sonic Pool in Hollywood, CA for sound design and mixing.

**We received multiple accolades and awards since the series wrapped up including, but not limited to:**

**As a marketing vehicle, the show has also garnerd impressive statistics:**
